    Find optimal preparations

    This function acts jointly with 'opt_state' function. The objective is to generate the set of
    optimal states for a set of measurements M. It produces a dictionary 'opt_preps' that contains
    the optimal preparations for a given combination of measurement operators.

    Inputs
    ------
    M: a list of lists whose elements are matrices of size dim x dim.
        M is a list containing n lists. Each list inside M corresponds to a different measurement in
        the QRAC task. For each measurement there are 'out' measurement operators.
    dim: an integer.
        dim represents the dimension of the measurement operators.
    n: an integer.

    out: an integer.

    is a matrix of size dim x dim.
        Every element of this dictionary corresponds to a rank-one density matrix for a given prepa-
        ration of Alice. In a n-dits QRAC, in which the dits are labelled as x_1, x_2, ..., x_n, for
        every combination of dits, a state is prepared by Alice and sent to Bob. The dictionary 'opt
        _preps' contains the optimal preparations related to each combination of dits. It is optimal
        in the sense that it maximizes the figure-of-merit 'success probability' for a given set of
        measurements.

    Let us say that a QRAC with 3 dits is set. Then, we indicate a combination of measurement opera-
    tors by a tuple of size 3. The tuple (3, 4, 5) indicates the third outcome for the first measu-
    rement, the fourth outcome for the second measurement and the fifth for the third measurement.

    Find the Quantum Random Acces Code quantum value
    ------------------------------------------------

    Main function. Here I perform a see-saw optimization for the nË†(dim) --> 1 QRAC. This function
    can be described in a few elementary steps, as follows:

        1. Create a set of n random measurements with 'out' outcomes acting dimension 'dim' with 'ge
        nerate_random_measurements'.
        2. For this set of measurements, find the set optimal preparations using 'find_opt_prep'.
        3. Optimize the measurements for the set of optimal preparations found in step 2 using 'find
        _opt_meas'.
        4. Check if the variables 'prob_value' and 'M' are converging. If not, return to step 2 till
        the difference between 'previous_prob_value' and 'prob_value' is smaller than PROB_BOUND.
        Also, the loop should terminate either when 'max_norm_difference' is smaller than MEAS_BOUND
        or when the number of iterations is bigger than 'iterations.

    This function also checks if the obtained optimal measurements are MUBs by activating 'determine
    _meas_status' function.

    Inputs
    ------
    n: an integer.
        n represents the number of distinct measurements.
    dim: an integer.
        The dimension of the measurement operators.
    seeds: an integer.
        Represents the number of random seeds as the starting point of the see-saw algorithm.
    out: an integer. [optional]
        The number of outcomes for the measurements. If no value is attributed to 'out', then out =
        dim.
    meas_status: True or False. True by default. [optional]
        If true, it activates the function determine_meas_status for details about the optimized
        measurements.
    PROB_BOUND: a float. [optional]
        Convergence criterion for the variable 'prob_value'. When the difference between 'prob_va-
        lue' and 'previous_prob_value' is less than PROB_BOUND, the algorithm interprets prob_value
        = previous_prob_value.
    MEAS_BOUND: a float. [optional]
        The same criterion as in PROB_BOUND but for the norms of the measurement operators in the
        variable M.
    bias: a dictionary of size n * out ** n. bias.keys() are tuples of n + 2 coordinates. bias.value
    s() are floats.
        The dictionary 'bias' represents a order-(n+2) tensor enconding the bias in some given QRAC.
    weight: a float or a list of floats of size 'out'.
        The varible 'weight' carries the weight (or weights) with which the QRAC is biased. If it is
        a single float, it must be a positive number between 0 and 1. If it is a list of floats, it
        must sum to 1.
        Note that, for the case in which 'weight' is a single float, this variable is symmetrical.
        That is, setting weight = 0.5 has the same effect as making bias = None.

    Check if two measurements are mutually unbiased
    -----------------------------------------------

    This function works jointly with 'determine_meas_status' function. It simply gets two 'dim'-di-
    mensional measurements P and Q, and checks if they are constructed out of Mutually Unbiased Ba-
    ses. Check appendix II of the supplementary material of the reference for details.

    Inputs
    ------
    P: a list with 'out' matrices of size dim x dim.
        A measurement with 'out' outcomes acting on dimension 'dim'.
    Q: a list with 'out' matrices of size dim x dim.
        Another measurement with 'out' outcomes acting on dimension 'dim'.
    out: an integer.
        out represents the number of outcomes of the measurements.
    MUB_BOUND: a float.
        If PQP-P < MUB_BOUND, then the equation PQP = P is considered satisfied and the measurements
        P and Q are considered mutually unbiased.

    Output
    ------
    status: a dictionary with two entries. A boolean variable and a float.
        The first key of this dictionary is named 'boolean'. If 'True', P and Q are considered mutu-
        ally unbiased up to the numerical precision of MUB_BOUND. The second key is named 'max_er-
        ror' and contains the maximum norm difference by which the measurement operators of P and Q
        do not satisfy the equations PQP = P and QPQ = Q.

    Generate bias
    -------------

    This function generates a dictionary in which the keys are tuples of the form

    i = ((x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_n), y, b)

    where x_1, x_2, x_3, ... , x_n and b range from 0 to out - 1 and y ranges from 0 to n - 1. The
    object bias tensor[i] represents a order-(n+2) tensor enconding the bias in some given QRAC.

    If bias = None, the QRAC is unbiased and all of the n * out ** n elements in bias_tensor are
    uniform. The elements of bias_tensor are strictly bigger than zero whenever i[2] == i[0][i[1]].

    There are seven possible kinds of bias, as follows.
    1. "XDIAG". Bias in the input string x. The elements of the main diagonal of the order-n tensor
    i[0] are prefered with probability 'weight'. For the n = 2 QRAC, it translates as

    x_1/x_2 | 0  1  2 ... out-1
    0       | *  .  .       .
    1       | .  *  .       .
    2       | .  .  *       .
    :       |
    out-1   | .  .  .       *

    2. "XCHESS". Bias in the input string x. The elements of the order-n tensor i[0] are prefered
    with probability 'weight', in an array that resembles a chess table. If n = 2,

    x_1/x_2 | 0  1  2 ... out-1
    0       | .  *  .       *
    1       | *  .  *       .
    2       | .  *  .       *
    :       |
    out-1   | *  .  *       .

    3. "XPARAM". Bias in the input string x. The element (0, 0, ..., 0) of the order-n tensor i[0]
    is prefered probability 'weight'

    4. "YPARAM". Bias in the requested digit y. The element 0 of i[1] is prefered with probability
    'weight'.

    5. "YVEC". Bias in the requested digit y. The y-th element of i[1] is prefered with probability
    'weight[y]'.

    6. "BPARAM". Bias in the retrived output b. The element 0 of i[2] is prefered with probability
    'weight'.

    7. "BVEC". Bias in the retrived output b. The b-th element of i[2] is prefered with probability
    'weight[b]'.

    Inputs
    ------
    n: an integer.
        n represents the number of distinct measurements.
    out: an integer.
        out represents the number of outcomes of the measurements.
    bias: a string or an empty variable ('None').
        It encodes the type of bias desired for the computation. There are seven possibilities: "XDI
        AG", "XCHESS", "XPARAM", "YPARAM", "YVEC", "BPARAM" and "BVEC".
    weight: a float or a list of floats of size 'out'.
        The varible 'weight' carries the weight (or weights) with which the QRAC is biased. If it is
        a single float, it must be a positive number between 0 and 1. If it is a list of floats, it
        must sum to 1.
        Note that, for the case in which 'weight' is a single float, this variable is symmetrical.
        That is, setting weight = 0.5 has the same effect as making bias = None.

    Output
    ------
    bias_tensor: a dictionary of size n * out ** n. bias_tensor.keys() are tuples of n + 2 coordina-
    tes. bias_tensor.values() are floats.
        bias_tensor represents a order-(n+2) tensor enconding the bias in some given QRAC.
