QRACs
-----
A Quantum Random Acess Code, mostly known by its acronym QRAC, is a task in which n dits are encoded
into a qudit. The aim of this task is to recover one of the dits chosen uniformly at random. A QRAC
is generally represented by its parameters nË†(d) --> 1, in which n is the number of dits, and d is
the size of the dits, as well as the dimension of the qudit.

This program encounters the maximum value of a QRAC by performing a see-saw optimization. Encounter-
ing the 'maximum value' of a QRAC means that we aim to maximize the functional associated with it.

The main function of this code is implemented in find_QRAC_value(n, d, seeds), in which it is pos-
sible to input n, d, and the number of seeds to be used in the see-saw optimization.
